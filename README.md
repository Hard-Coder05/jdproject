## Project Description
##### This project currently includes two HTML based pages which are connected to their respective CSS files. The Registration page is connected to a mySQL database working on an Apache server joined up using Xampp. This page is used to store data in the database. It currently includes five fields namely first name, last name, email, employee code and password; where employee code is a unique field that means this field should be unique for every row in the database. The second page is the login page that takes reference from the data stored on the database, checks it and gives access to the user to enter his/her profile only if the entered employee code and password are correct.
