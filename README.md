## Project Purpose
##### This is a project made by me during a one-month winter intern (from 01-12-2019 to 31-12-2019) while I was studying in the first year of my undergraduate programme(B.Tech at NIT Raipur) at Jindal Steel & Power Limited Raigarh. This project is made under the guidance and mentorship of Mr. Sambit Mishra(IT executive, JSPL Raigarh). This project could not have been possible without the support, interest and allowance of Mr. Virendra Sharma (HOD IT & SAP Department, JSPL Raigarh)
## Project Description
##### This project was made during the one month winter intern at IT dept, JSPL, Raigarh.
#####I created a live work order status portal for IT department JSPL Raigarh. I used the XAMPP package so as to create web applications with Apache2, PHP and a MySQL database and host it using a local webhost. I used PhpMyAdmin as the MySQL administrative tool.
#####The basic purpose of this project is to provide a live tracking of work orders and shoot up automatic E-mails to the concerned person at regular intervals so as to remind him/her about the ongoing Work Orders and their pending payment. The portal also has features for adding, deleting, editing and searching of work orders.
#####The webpages were created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The main working script behind the data insertion, updation, retrieval was of PHP.
