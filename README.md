# jdproject
## Project Description
 
##### I created a live work order status portal for IT department JSPL Raigarh. I used the XAMPP package so as to create web applications with Apache2, PHP and a MySQL database and host it using a local webhost. I used PhpMyAdmin as the MySQL administrative tool.
##### The basic purpose of this project is to provide a live tracking of work orders and shoot up automatic E-mails to the concerned person at regular intervals so as to remind him/her about the ongoing Work Orders and their pending payment. The portal has features for adding, deleting, editing and searching of work orders.
##### The webpages were created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The main working script behind the data insertion, updation, retrieval was of PHP.
##### The whole project contains one database named 'jdproject' and two tables in it namely 'work_order' and 'register'.
##### This project was made during the one month winter intern 2019 at IT dept, JSPL, Raigarh.
